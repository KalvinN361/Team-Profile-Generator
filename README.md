# 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

  ![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
  ## Description
 Your task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays  summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you’ll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video AND add it to the readme of your project.
